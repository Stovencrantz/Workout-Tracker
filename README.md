## Usage:
The user will first enter a workout, where they decide between a 'cardio' or 'resistance' excercise and then enter information into the respective fields. Once the user finished entering the data for their planned exercise, they can either add another exercise to their workout or complete that workout. The user can enter multiple Exercises per workout and multiple workouts per day if they wish. The user can even continue off of a previous workout with the `continue workout` button. Finally, the user can navigate to their Dashboard to see their exercise results over the past week through a series of graphs.
